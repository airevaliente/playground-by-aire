1. remind_me: My remind_me function is useful to remember appointments that are 
the same every week. It prints "Weekly appointments" and returns  all of my 
weekly appointments as strings. 

2. Cheat: My cheat function is useful to cheat on exams. If you enter either 
Q3.1.3 or Q3.1.12 or Q3.1.16, it returns a big string that contains the code 
that is the correct answer to that question.

3. make_art: My make_art function creates colorful images with ggplot and the 
R Color Brewer package. The function generates random data and assigns names; 
then it crates a plot and fills it with the colors from the random palette.
